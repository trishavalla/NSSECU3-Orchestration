# NSSECU3-Orchestration
This project automates the execution of multiple forensic tools—EvtxECmd, RECmd, and AppCompatCacheParser—to streamline digital forensic investigations. The script runs these tools sequentially, collects their outputs, and merges the results into a structured CSV file for easy analysis.
